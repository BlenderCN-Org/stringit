HOW TO USE:

The String It tool is found in the 3D view's tool panel when you hit 'T'.
To make the initial curve, select the scene items you want the curve to run through.
Once you have what you want, hit 'Make Curve'

Options:
Spline Type - You can choose here between whether or not you want a straight polyline or a bezier curves
running through your objects.

Close Shape - Use this to close add one more segment to close the curve.

Finalize and Attach - Places hook modifiers on the curve to attach it's points to each of the objects.

WARNING:
If you select out of this, you lose the option to attach the curve using the tool.
Also, Finalizing and attachment completes the operator.  Only use it when you know you have the curve
configuration you want.
